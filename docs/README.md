## Requirements

## Features

### Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone git@bitbucket.org:tisas/sas-frontend-boilerplate.git my-new-project

# 2. Enter your newly-cloned folder
cd my-new-project

# 3. Install dependencies
yarn install

# 4. Compiles and hot-reloads for development
yarn serve
```

::: tip
After you've cloned the project you will see a folder called _**docs**_, which have all the documentation about this boilerplate. It's not necessary to maintain it, you can remove it and all _VuePress_ dependencies or you can use it to organize your documentation :notebook:.
